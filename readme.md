# Signals and Systems Sessional (AVE 4502 )

This repository contains MATLAB scripts  created during the AVE 4502 course I took during my 5th semester. The purpose of this repository is to store, share and document the scripts used during the course.

## Rationale of the Course:
To understand and apply the basics of electrical signals as well as the analysis and design of systems.

## Course Objectives:
1. Teach the basics of MATLAB from signals and systems perspective.
2. Help students simulate the generation of signals and operations on them.
3. Familiarize the students Fourier, Laplace and Z transforms.

## Course Outcomes (CO):
Upon completion of all sessional, the students will be able to:
1. Generate matrices of various dimensions, various signals and sequences and perform operations
on signals.
2. Obtain the frequency domain representation of signals and sequences using Fourier transform,
Laplace and z transform.
3. Apply the concept of convolution and correlation.
4. Produce various types of noise and measure various characteristics of noise
